## Installation üë®‚Äçüíª
1. Fork the repo and clone in down
2. Create a Supabase account
3. Save you database password from Supabase setup
4. In your Supabase account click on `Connect` and copy your database connection from `Transaction pooler` section
5. In your terminal run `npm install` command to install all required dependencies
6. In the root directory create a `.env.production` file and set `DATABASE_URL=*your URL*`. Change \*your URL\* to your actual database connection URL you have copied in `step 4`. Make sure to change `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` to your actual database password you have saved in `step 3`
7. Go to [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com) and create a free account. Save your API key
8. In the root directory create a `.env.api` file and set `API_KEY=*your-api-key*`. Change \*your-api-key\* to your actual API key you have saved in `step 7`.
9. In your terminal run a command `npm run seed` to create a table with cities and seed it with data
10. Run `npm test integrations.test.js` to make sure everything is set up and working correctly. If all tests fails try to remove `.skip` from the last test in `integrations.test.js` to check if there is a problem with the API key. If problem is not related to the Weather API key - look into seeding
